        Certification as a national ESB Coach last three years and requires a deep understanding of the Effective School Boards framework, 
        the ability to demonstrate that understanding in practice, and the ability to support governance teams through its implementation. 
        These competencies are revealed through demonstrations of learning regarding:
        <ul>
          <li>Governance Knowledge (GK 1-12)</li>
          <li>Governance Skill (GS 1-9) </li>
          <li>Governance Mindset (GM 1-3)</li>
          <li>Coaching Knowledge (CK 1-7)</li>
          <li>Coaching Skill (CS 1-6)</li>
          <li>Coaching Mindset (CM 1-6)</li> 
        </ul><br />

        Unless there is a 
        demonstration of learning (DoL) defined in the competency, each competency type relies on a default DoL. The default DoL for 
        knowledge competencies is a one page writing. The default DoL for skills competencies is a written or video artifact. The default 
        DoL for mindset competencies is coach observation with rubric. Alternative DoLs can be determined by a Senior Coach.

        <h5>Certification Maintenance Requirements</h5>
        Maintenance of ESB Coach certification requires earning 10 points per year. If a coach does not earn at least 10 points per 
        year, their certification will lapse and they will need to complete the full certification process again from the beginning. 
        Where pre-approval or determination of effectiveness is required, a Senior ESB Coach is able to provide.
        <br/><br/>

        Coaches earn points in any of the following ways:
        <ul>

        </ul><br/>
        
        
        <h5>Certification Renewal Requirements</h5>
        Renewal of ESB Coach certification requires earning at least 50 points during the term of certification and at least 30 
        days prior to the expiration of their existing certification. If this has not been completed, then certification lapses and 
        the coach will need to complete the full certification process again from the beginning.
          <br/><br/>
        


        <h5>Certification Revocation</h5>
        Recovation of ESB Coach certification may happen at any time and is a decision of the majority of currently certified Senior 
        ESB Coaches. Prior to recovation, a progressive approach to addressing unacceptable behavior is preferable. Initial certification may also 
        be withheld if, at the time that certification ordinarily would have been conveyed, the individual is determined by a majority of the 
        Senior ESB Coaches to be out of compliance with any of the following revocation criteria. Revocation may be warranted for circumstances 
        that include, but are not limited to:
        <ul>
          <li>Deficiencies identified in evaluations or other communications by a Senior ESB Coach.</li>
          <li>Neglect of duties or responsibilities, or the conduct of other business that is deemed incompatible with ESB ceritifcation.</li>
          <li>Incompetence or inefficiency in the performance of expected duties;</li>
          <li>Failure to comply with laws or with ESB's policies.</li>
          <li>Drunkenness or excessive use of alcoholic beverages; illegal use of drugs, hallucinogens, or other controlled substances, 
            or the possession, use, or being under the influence of alcohol, alcoholic beverages, drugs or controlled substances while 
            on school property, acting within the scope of a certified coach's duties, or attending any school or school system-sponsored activity.</li>
          <li>Conviction of a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude.</li>
          <li>Failure to meet the ESB's standards of professional conduct.</li>
          <li>Immorality, which is conduct the majority of Senior ESB Coaches determine is not in conformity with the accepted moral 
            standards of the community of ESB Coaches.</li>
