<h4><strong>Maybe societal progress hinges on the sum of our collective struggles and aspirations.<br/>
Maybe we can infuence that progress by having each sapiosentient in our society maximize their contribution.<br/>
Maybe the destiny of our society requires an astronomically large number of fully maximized sapiosentients.<br/>
Would it take 1 billion maximized sapiosentients? 1 trillion? 1 quadrillion? Maybe even 1 <i>quint</i>illion?
