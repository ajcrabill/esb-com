    <h1>Effective School Boards: Coaching, frameworks, and tools to help school boards improve student outcomes</h1>
<p>Effective School Boards helps locally elected boards, superintendents, and state associations focus their governance on what students know and can do. We provide a clear framework, practical tools, and certified coaching so boards can measure, practice, and sustain the adult behavior changes that drive better student outcomes. We work with school systems and state partners across the United States. (<a href="https://effectiveschoolboards.com/">effectiveschoolboards.com</a>)</p>
<p>Our work centers on the Effective School Boards Framework, a research-informed continuous improvement model that clarifies community vision and values, sets measurable goals and guardrails, monitors progress, aligns resources, and communicates results. Boards use the framework to score where they are, then re-score quarterly to track growth. The intent is simple and demanding: student outcomes do not change until adult behaviors change. (<a href="https://effectiveschoolboards.com/framework/about">effectiveschoolboards.com</a>)</p>
<p>We support boards with hands-on coaching and a growing set of resources. District teams and state associations engage us for 2-day transformation workshops, quarterly self-evaluations, time-use evaluations of board meetings, superintendent evaluation supports, goal and guardrail examples, and board member onboarding materials. A bi-weekly newsletter, The Effective School Board Member, gives timely answers to tough governance questions. (<a href="https://effectiveschoolboards.com/workshop/?utm_source=openai">effectiveschoolboards.com</a>)</p>
<p>Our origin is practical. After coding hundreds of hours of board meetings from every corner of the U.S., we saw most boards spending far too little time on student outcomes and far too much on adult inputs. We built a national framework and coach certification to change that, and we collaborate with the Effective School Boards Initiative to expand the research base that underpins this work.

<p>The people behind ESB include practitioners and researchers. Senior Coach AJ Crabill, author of Great On Their Behalf, also serves as Director of Governance at the Council of the Great City Schools. He received the Education Commission of the States James Bryant Conant Award for extraordinary contributions to K-12 education. Our Initiative collaborators include scholars from the University of Georgia, University of North Texas, Ohio State University, and UNLV, with advisors from Northwest University, Vanderbilt, and CGCS.

<p>How we work and what we value
- Student-first mindset: governance exists to improve student outcomes, so we structure agendas, monitoring, and evaluations to reflect that purpose. (<a href="https://effectiveschoolboards.com/framework/about">effectiveschoolboards.com</a>)
- Community ownership: boards represent the community’s vision and values; goals and guardrails make those priorities explicit and measurable. (<a href="https://effectiveschoolboards.com/framework/about">effectiveschoolboards.com</a>)
- Transparency and cadence: simple routines, public monitoring, and quarterly self-evaluations build trust and sustained focus. (<a href="https://effectiveschoolboards.com/framework/">effectiveschoolboards.com</a>)
- Coaching plus training: workshops start the shift; coaching helps adult behaviors change and stick. (<a href="https://effectiveschoolboards.com/coaches/become">effectiveschoolboards.com</a>)</p>
