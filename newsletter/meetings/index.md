Have a school board meeting that you and/or other school board members could benefit from one of our coaches analyzing? Provide the link to the video -- it must be a publicly available video for a public school board meeting -- in the form below and we will add it to the (very long) list of meetings to review and post about in <a href="/board-member-newsletter/">The Effective School Board Member</a>. Also indicate if you would want to be mentioned by name, by district, by state, or not at all.<br/><br/>
