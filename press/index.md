    <h1>Press and media</h1>
<p>Effective School Boards and our senior coaches are frequently invited to speak and write about student-outcomes-focused governance, goals and guardrails, public monitoring, and the adult behavior changes that improve student results. Coverage spans national education outlets, mainstream media, and podcasts that profile the framework and its use by boards and state partners. (<a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/can-this-school-board-be-saved-author-aj-crabill-has-a-5-point-plan/">the74million.org</a>)</p>
<p>Topics we are asked to discuss include redesigning board agendas and time use, linking superintendent evaluation to student goals, statewide adoption through associations, and lessons learned coaching boards in urban, suburban, and rural contexts across the U.S. (<a href="https://effectiveschoolboards.com/framework/">effectiveschoolboards.com</a>)</p>
