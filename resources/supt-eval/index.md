Effective school boards consider superintendent evaluation to be identical to school system evaluation. For this reason, 100% of superintendent evaluation is based on progress relative to the Goals and Guardrails. The Board&rsquo;s annual evaluation of the superintendent then becomes a summary of results reported throughout the year through progress monitoring. The annual evaluation allows the board to summarize its judgment of the Superintendent&rsquo;s performance based on the objective evidence given through the monitoring report data provided throughout the previous year. The Board has the opportunity to discuss performance highs and lows and make a measured determination as to whether the current Superintendent remains adequate. The Board will also be able to deal with any adjustments to contract and compensation accordingly at this time.
