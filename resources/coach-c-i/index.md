The expectation is straightforward, though not easy: aim for the top of Bloom’s and the right of ICAP’s during coach-facilitated sessions:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Ideally any new information that we want participants to remember or understand will be provided in at least two ways (writing or audio or video) in addition to coach-facilitated sessions</li>
  <li>Often the first half of any coach-facilitated session  will be used to have participants apply current ideas and draw connections among current ideas</li>
  <li>Ideally at least the second half of each coach-facilitated session will be used to connect current ideas, debate current ideas, and/or present new ideas</li>
  <li>We’ll accomplish this by designing curriculum that focuses on the top half of Blooms, and even outside of coach-facilitated sessions, we’re actively shifting from Passive and Active expectations of our participants to Constructive and Interactive expectations.</li>

<h5>Key Ideas</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Flip the classroom<ul>
<li>Maintain a coach to participant focus ratio of 1:4 (coach is the focus for no more than 12 minutes of each hour) during sessions</li>
<li>The value creation of coach-facilitated sessions is in participants having coach-guided conversations with each other about implementing the five behaviors of continuous improvement</li>
<li>The value creations outside of whole-board coaching sessions are:<ul>
  <li>mindset coaching (supporting shifts in mindset that allow for empowered approach to problems) </li>
  <li>skill coaching (supporting participants with using our tools in their weekly practice)</li>
  <li>knowledge delivery (providing information about the work we’ll be doing together in the next 30 days)</li>
</ul></li>
  </ul><br/><br/></li>


<li>Practice thinking, not regurgitation<ul>
<li>Make participants create a rough draft before giving examples</li>
<li>Use think-pair-share exercises</li>
<li>Use shoulder partner structured discussion and/or debate exercises</li>
<li>The value creation of coach-facilitated sessions is in participants having coach-guided conversations with each other about implementation; related to the five behaviors of school board continuous improvement, have them think about what’s happened, what worked, what didn’t work, what they will do next</li>
<li>Metacognition -- thinking about how they’d think about something in a given situation -- is valuable</li>
<li>Writing -- maybe a think-journal-pair-share -- is valuable for structuring thinking</li>
  </ul><br/><br/></li>
 
<li>Employ short cycle assessments<ul>
<li>Always provide feedback within 3 hours of a demonstration of learning (and definitely no longer than within 3 days)</li>
<li>Have participants grade fellow participants</li>
  </ul><br/><br/></li>

<li>Retrieval practice is essential <ul>
<li>Repeat the progression at each step of the progression</li>
<li>Start subsequent days of instruction by having participants recall everything they can about previous day instruction</li>
<li>Give the same quiz of ESB basics multiple times throughout the year</li>
<li>Have participants recall multiple examples with decreasing time windows</li>
  </ul><br/><br/></li>

<li>Emotional anchoring is essential<ul>
<li>Have participants reflect on their own practice using behavior-cost-benefit-pretending </li>
<li>This isn’t about right or wrong, but it is about what’s worked and what hasn’t worked</li>
<li>Using real life examples where their behaviors may have made it harder for students to be successful is more useful; using hypothetical examples or examples of other people’s behavior is less useful</li>
  </ul><br/><br/></li>

<li>Calibrate for introversion, not extroversion<ul>
<li>Actively avoid the requirement for small talk; always have discussion prompts</li>
<li>Actively avoid the requirement for self seeking groups; always have assigned groups</li>
<li>Provide people with materials in advance so that they have processing time</li>
  </ul><br/><br/></li>

<li>Design for connection and belonging<ul>
<li>The value creation of coach-facilitated sessions is in participants having coach-guided conversations with each other such that they feel increasingly connected to each other</li>
<li>We want participants to experience a sense of belonging in the student outcomes family</li>
  </ul><br/><br/></li>
