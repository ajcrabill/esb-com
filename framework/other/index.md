  <h5>Multiple Frameworks, One Vision</h5>  
  Many different school board governance frameworks have emerged over the past decade, but overall they have
  more in common than not. For starters, each of them attempts to bring a student outcomes focused approach to
  school board governance. And each of them are grounded in roughly the same set of <a href="/resources">
  research</a> insights. But the similarities extend beyond even those things.<br/><br/>

  Each of these variants offers to enhance organizational alignment through the deployment of techniques
  popularized by thinkers such as Covey, Marzano, and Collins. And each of them borrow heavily from the 
  governance and governance vs management ideas offered by Alsbury, Carver, and Drucker.<br/><br/>

  But while they all share common roots, they have each grown in unique directions. Here's an attempt at summarizing
  some of the key variations.<br/><br/>


   <h5>Effective School Boards, EffectiveSchoolBoards.com</h5> 
   <ul>
<li><strong>Origin: </strong>Created by school board coaches in 2021, this framework was popularized 
  by the book, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Their-Behalf-School-Effective/dp/1544534876/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=esb0b3-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=fac456155eede9a203956cc5dd672283&camp=1789&creative=9325">Great On Their Behalf</a> and has been 
utilized by school boards is several countries and in states all across the US.</li>
<li><strong>Page-by-Page Structure: </strong>This framework is based on the five-step continuous improvement
cycle described in Great On Their Behalf.</li>
<li><strong>Left-to-Right Structure: </strong>ESB is organized by implementation timeline -- early implementation 
  items are on the left while later implementation items are on the right</li>
<li><strong>Coach Certification: </strong>Currently, ESB and SOFG coach certification are 100% aligned so SOFG Coaches are granted ESB 
  certification as well. Coaches with LSG certification are about 70% of the way to ESB certification; ESB coaches only have to pass 
  a Texas-specific quiz and are then also LSG certified. Be Legendary and SSG coach certifications are still under development. 
  ESB Coach certification is open to anyone who meets the <a href="/coaches/become">certification requirements</a>. ESB certification 
is always intended to be the open, national standard for school board coach certification. As such, it is the most rigorous process for 
  achieving certification out of all of the following frameworks.</li>

<h5>Student Outcomes Focused Governance, Council of the Great City Schools</h5>
   <ul>
<li><strong>Origin: </strong>A group of school board members and superintendents with the Council of the Great City Schools (CGCS) began 
  development of the Student Outcomes Focused Governance (SOFG) framework in 2014. It has since been adopted by dozens of the nation's 
largest urban-serving school systems.</li>
<li><strong>Page-by-Page Structure: </strong>This framework is based on the National School Board Associations, "Key Work of School Boards". </li>
<li><strong>Left-to-Right Structure: </strong>The SOFG framework is organized by evidence of impact on improving student outcomes -- 
  items with less research-based evidence are on the left while items with a stronger evidence base are on the right.</li>
  <li><strong>Coach Certification: </strong>Currently, SOFG and ESB coach certification are 100% aligned so all SOFG Coaches are immediately 
recognized as having earned ESB ceritifcation as well. SOFG certification generally requires participation in the SOFG coach pipeline 
or some other CGCS affiliation.</li>

<h5>Lone Star Governance, State of Texas</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Origin: </strong>A group of school board members and school board trainers, convened by the Texas Education Agency (TEA), 
began development of the Lone Star Governance (LSG) framework in 2016. Each year, school boards all across the state compete to gain 
  access to grants that support LSG implementation.</li>
  <li><strong>Page-by-Page Structure: </strong>LSG is designed around the Texas Framework for School Board Development adopted by the 
  Texas State Board of Education.</li>
  <li><strong>Left-to-Right Structure: </strong>The LSG framework is organized by evidence of impact on improving student outcomes -- 
items with less research-based evidence are on the left while items with a stronger evidence base are on the right.</li>
  <li><strong>Coach Certification: </strong>Of the three states with effective school board governance frameworks, only Texas has a robust 
coach certification process. Coaches with LSG certification are roughly 70% of the way toward earning their national school board  
coach certification. Discussions are underway to further close that gap.</li>

 <h5>Be Legendary Governance, State of North Dakota</h5>
 <ul>
   <li><strong>Origin: </strong>Developed in 2020 through a partnership between the North Dakota School Board Association and the 
  North Dakota Department of Public Instruction, the Be Legendary School Board Leadership Institute has rapidly been embraced by
the state's highest performance school boards. Be Legendary is explicitly customized to the unique needs and context of school boards in North Dakota.</li>
   <li><strong>Page-by-Page Structure: </strong>Be Legendary is based on North Dakota's six critical pillars to transform school 
board performance.</li>

items with less research-based evidence are on the left while items with a stronger evidence base are on the right.</li>
  <li><strong>Coach Certification: </strong>The Be Legendary team is still completing development of its coach certification framework.</li>

<h5>Silver State Governance, Nevada Association of School Boards</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Origin: </strong>Created by the Nevada Association of School Boards in 2020 in partnership with the Nevada State Board 
of Education and the Nevada Department of Education. SSG was written to address the needs and legal realities of Nevada school boards.</li>
<li><strong>Page-by-Page Structure: </strong>This framework is based on the Eight Characteristics of Effective School Boards. </li>
<li><strong>Left-to-Right Structure: </strong>The SSG framework is organized by evidence of impact on improving student outcomes -- 
  items with less research-based evidence are on the left while items with a stronger evidence base are on the right.</li>
<li><strong>Coach Certification: </strong>SSG does not yet have a unique coach certification pathway.</li>

 <h5>Policy Governance Principle Consistency Framework, Govern for Impact</h5>
 <ul>
   <li><strong>Origin: </strong>Govern for Impact, formerly the International Policy Governance Association, is a global standard bearer 
for the style of governance popularized by John & Mariam Carver. The framework was originally developed by Govern's Principle Consistency Committee in 
  2012. While this framework shares many governance theory similarities with the ones above, it was created for general governance applications, 
not specifically for public school board governance like the ones above were.</li>
 <li><strong>Page-by-Page Structure: </strong>This framework is based on the ten principles of policy governance consistency. </li>
 <li><strong>Left-to-Right Structure: </strong>NA</li>
 <li><strong>Coach Certification: </strong>Govern provides certification through its Policy Governance Proficiency program.</li>
