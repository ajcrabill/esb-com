        <h5>Using the Framework Instrument</h5>
        This instrument is best used by the full governing team -- the school board and superintendent -- with guidance from a coach specifically certified in its application. After receiving an orientation to the framework, each individual school board member and the superintendent should give the school board a score for each practice area. When the score for each practice area is added together, this will reveal an overall score between 0 and 100, where a 0 indicates that the school board is ineffectively focusing on its goals for improving student outcomes and a 100 which indicates that the school board is highly effective at focusing on its goals for improving student outcomes. After each member of the governing team have scored the school board individually, then the coach will lead the governing team collectively through a process of scoring the school board for the first time. This will create the school board’s starting point data which, in addition to providing a measurable score, provides the school board with clarity about its strengths and weaknesses relative to being an effective school board. 
        <br/><br/>
        Once a starting point has been set, the school board should schedule time during a public meeting every three months to go through this process again as a means of self evaluating over time. Ideally each quarter the school board’s focus on improving student outcomes meaningfully increases. When using the instrument to conduct an evaluation, most indicators should be evaluated for the previous three month period unless indicated otherwise. Indicators that are about training and listening should generally be evaluated for the previous thirty-six month period unless indicated otherwise.
        <br/><br/>
        It is typical to go from a score of 0 to a score of 80+ over the course of two years, but only with the aid of a coach certified in this work. School boards that attempt this work without the support of a coach almost always fail; the adult behavior changes required are simply too great.

                      The Board received training on listening for the community’s vision and using what the Board hears to set SMART goals.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board included students, parents, staff, and community members in the goal development process.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board relied on a root cause analysis, comprehensive student needs assessment, and/or similar research-based tool to inform identification of and prioritization of potential goals.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board has developed, in collaboration with the Superintendent, a set of goals that represent the community’s vision for what students should know and be able to do.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board publicly posted the goals for public comment prior to adoption.
                      <br/><br/>
                      In addition to the goal ending points, the Board has identified annual targets, goal ending points for each year leading up to the ending dates.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board has developed no fewer than one and no more than five goals. A max of three is recomm- ended because fewer goals allow for greater focus; more allow for less.

                  <td class="EffectiveBody">
                      All of the interim goals are predictive of their respective goals, and are influenceable by the Superintendent (and the Superintendent’s team). Predictive suggests that there is some evidence of a correlation between the interim goal and the goal. Influenceable suggests that the Superintendent -- and through them, the staff -- has authority over roughly 80% of the inputs the interim goal is measuring.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Superintendent has provided interim goal ending points for each year leading up to the ending date.
                      <br/><br/>
                      All interim goals pertain to student outputs or student outcomes, not inputs or adult outputs.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The status of each interim goal is able to be updated multiple times during each school year.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Superintendent has adopted, in collaboration with the Board, one to three interim goals to progress monitor each goal, and each interim goal is SMART -- includes a specific measure, population, starting point, an ending point, a starting date, and an ending date. The recommended number of interim goals is three.

                  <td class="HighlyEffectiveBody">
                      The Board adopted goals using a process that included students, parents, staff, and community members in a way that led them to express ownership of the adopted goals.

                      The Board included students, parents, staff, and community members in the guardrail development process.

                      The Board publicly posted the guardrails for public comment prior to adoption.

                      The Board has developed, in collaboration with the Superintendent, guardrails based on the community’s values and that do not hinder pursuit of the goals. Each guardrail describes a single operational action or class of actions the Superintendent may not use or allow in pursuit of the goals.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board has developed no fewer than one and no more than five guardrails. A max of three is recommended because fewer guardrails allow for greater focus; more allow for less.

                      All of the interim guardrails are predictive of their respective guardrails, and are influenceable by the Superintendent (and the Superintendent’s team). Predictive suggests that there is some evidence of a correlation between the interim guardrail and the guardrail. Influenceable suggests that the Superintendent -- and through them, the staff -- has authority over roughly 80% of whatever the interim guardrail is measuring.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Superintendent has provided interim guardrail ending points for each year leading up to the ending date.

                      All interim guardrails pertain to outputs or outcomes, not inputs.

                      The status of each interim guardrail is able to be updated multiple times during each school year.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Superintendent has adopted, in collaboration with the Board, one to three interim guardrails for each guardrail, and each interim guardrail is SMART.

                  <td class="HighlyEffectiveBody">
                      The Board adopted guardrails using a process that included students, parents, staff, and community members in a way that led them to express ownership of the adopted guardrails and, if applicable, theories of action.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board has considered adoption of one or more theories of action to drive the school system’s overall strategic direction. If there is a permanent Superintendent, that person was included in the theory consideration process.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The guardrails, interim guardrails, and theories of action will challenge the organization and require change in adult behaviors.
                      <br/><br/>
                      In addition to the guardrails on the Superintendent's authority, the Board has adopted one to five guardrails on its own behavior and evaluates itself against them at least quarterly.
                      <br/><br/>
                      All Board guardrails last from three to five years; all interim guardrails last from one to three years.

                      The Board has not hosted opportunities to listen to the vision and values of the community during the previous thirty-six month period.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board does not use a consent agenda.

                  <td class="EmergingBody">
                      The Board received training on listening for the community’s vision and values, and on community engagement and community outreach.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board received training on how to use an agenda diet to make Board meetings transparent and observable.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board limits its adoption of governance policy regarding school system operations to matters that are 1) required by law or 2) an appropriate exercise of the Board's oversight authority as defined by the Board's adopted goals and/or guardrails.
                      <br/><br/>
                      All consent-eligible items were placed on the consent agenda and all but a few were voted on using a consent agenda.
                  </td>
                  <td class="EffectiveBody">
                      There are no more than five Board-authorized public meetings per month and none lasts more than three hours.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board schedules no more than five topics for discussion during any one Board-authorized public meeting.
                      <br/><br/>
                      Existing policies that do not meet one of these criteria have been removed from the Board’s governance policy manual (though the Superintendent may retain them as part of administrative policy/regulation).
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board made no edits to the Board's regularly scheduled meeting agenda during the meeting and during the three business days before the meeting unless a state of emergency was declared.
                  </td>
                  <td class="HighlyEffectiveBody">
                      There are no more than three Board-authorized public meetings per month and none lasts more than two hours.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board schedules no more than three topics for discussion during any Board-authorized public meeting.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board received the final version of materials to be voted on at least seven to fourteen calendar days before the Board- authorized public meeting during which the materials would be considered.
                      <br/><br/>
                      The Board used a process that included students, parents, staff, and community members in a way that led them to express ownership of the adopted goals and guardrails.
